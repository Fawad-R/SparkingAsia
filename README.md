This project consists of two directories: `backend` and `frontend`.

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory and install dependencies:

```
cd backend
npm install
```

2. Seed the database:

```
npm run seed
```

3. Create Index:

```
npm run index
```

4. Start the backend server:

```
node server.js
```

5. Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and install dependencies:

```
cd frontend
npm install
```

6. Start the frontend development server:

```
npm start
```

After completing these steps, both the backend and frontend should be running locally.
